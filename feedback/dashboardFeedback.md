# Dashboard feedback

For the dashboard this was the feedback I received.
Dashboard:
* Maybe have the interactive labels not the column name in the dataset but the full name of that variable
* Also, for the total pop minimum interactive, thereâ€™s not a ton of values after 80,000. Maybe that can be the max of the interactive? 
* The tab names could be a little more descriptive
* Your dashboard takes a long time to load whenever you change the parameters. That might be because there's a large dataset that it has to work through and change. Have you tried making a smaller dataset of only the required values for each plot and exporting it as it's own .csv? That might speed up rendering time?
* For the column tab, I'd fully spell out the label "Num Sets" for the selector

I also got verbal feedback that was similar to this.

I made the following changes:
* Changed the label for the `Num Sets` slider to `Number of Sets`
* Changed the laber for `Total_Pop` to `Minimum Number of Cards Graded`
* I changed the tab names to `Scatter Plots`, `Column Charts` and `Line Plots`
