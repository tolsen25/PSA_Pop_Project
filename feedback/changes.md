# Feedback Process 

## Receiving Feedback:
I received feeback in class on Friday December 14th from Braeden Critchfield, Aaron O, and Camilla M.  They were a good group to get feedback from because of their differing levels of baseball knowledge and basebasll card knowledge. In general the feedback that I received were in three categories: context, formatting and graphics.

## Context:
One common point of feedback I received was to add more context to the blog posts.  I incorporated this feedback in the EDA by adding a background section and adding links to websites where the reader could learn more.  I also added context to the paragraphs that described the graphs to make them clearer to read

## Formatting:
Another point of feedback was to add lines in between the images so that the text wouldn't crash into the images.  It was a small fix, but helped to make the blog post easier to read.  In the process of talking with my classmates I also learned that I could include the code in code boxes using tick marks.  I added this into my scrapring blog post so that the code would be easier to follow.  This also helped to clean up some image formatting issues.

## Graphics
The third type of feedback had to do with the graphics and the the colors that I chose for the plots.  Admitedly they are not perfect, but other than trying to add more context to the graphs I decided to focus onto fixing the other issues instead of tinkering with the graphs.  The decision of what colors I want has a lot to do with the theme of the blog which I might decide to change.  So instead of having to change them all again I decided to postpone changing the colors of the graphs.
