# Feedback Process 

## Receiving Feedback:
I received feeback in class on Friday December 14th from Braeden Critchfield, Aaron O, and Camilla M.  They were a good group to get feedback from because of their differing levels of baseball knowledge and basebasll card knowledge. In general the feedback that I received were in two categories: context and formatting.

## Context:
One common point of feedback I received was to add more context to the blog posts.  I incorporated this feedback in to the scraping blog post by adding context to the paragraphs that described the code to make them more readable.

## Formatting:
Another point of feedback was to add lines in between the images so that the text wouldn't crash into the images.  It was a small fix, but helped to make the blog post easier to read.  In the process of talking with my classmates I also learned that I could include the code in code boxes using tick marks.  I added this into my scraping blog post so that the code would be easier to follow.  This also helped to clean up some image formatting issues.
