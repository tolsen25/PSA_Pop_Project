A lot of my toic feedback did not come in the form of formal written feedback.  Most of it was bouncing ideas off of classmates both in Stat386 but also in my other classes.  After finding the pop report data and that it was able to be scraped I scraped all of the data and then I started asking questions.  Once I started playing with the data I had some of my own questions which I sent to my friend Braeden who is in the class and also knows about baseball cards. These are the questions that I sent him: 

* Top 10 years for overall grading? What cards were they?
* Bottom 10 Years for overall grading
* Top 10 years for pop count 
* Top 10 Sets for gem %
* Bottom 10 Sets for gem %
* Top sets for a 9 or a 10
* Count of cards graded over time
* Top sets of each decade
* Distribution of grades by set for top sets
* Average grade for each decade
* Average grade for the most popular sets/most expensive cards

This was his response:
I like these questions! You could also consider if there's a company that has the best grades and if you can use a players stats to predict the grades of his cards. Newer cards are likelier to be in good condition because they are newer, so you could also try to find the expected gem % based on years since card was made and see if any years are better than average.

I decided that some of these questions could be answered via the EDA and that others could be answered via an interactive dashboard.  Some of the more specific card data I left out because that would require scraping more data.
